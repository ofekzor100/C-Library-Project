# C-Library-Project
C++ project for managing a library database.
Project's full detailed information is in the pdf file.
There might be issues relating to out-of-date information, thus the csv files given are blank, so the database should be created from scratch, using the app interface.
there might be issuses relating to the excel handling's of the csv files, like version, which might causing an exception in the program. To prevent that, if there is a problem , you can enter the csv files and save any ISBN coulmn entries as numbers.
